# About
Hello! I'm Vivian.

I'm a master's student in the **Learning Sciences and Technologies** program at the University of Pennsylvania.

Broadly, I'm interested in **applying research** from fields such as psychology and the learning sciences **to enhance the design and implementation of learning technologies, environments, and experiences.**

Prior to graduate school, I studied at UC San Diego, earning a degree in **Psychology** (with a Specialization in Developmental Psychology) and a minor in **Education Studies**.
