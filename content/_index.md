# About
Hello! I'm Vivian.

I'm an incoming master's student in the **Learning Sciences and Technologies** program at the University of Pennsylvania. 

Prior to graduate school, I studied at UC San Diego, graduating with a degree in **Psychology** (with a Specialization in Developmental Psychology) and a minor in **Education Studies**.

I'm interested in designing technology-enhanced learning experiences and environments that:  
1. engage students in deep learning  
2. enable students to apply their knowledge in novel contexts
