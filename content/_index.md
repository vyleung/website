# About
Hello! I'm Vivian.

I recently graduated with a Master's in **Learning Sciences and Technologies** from the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education (Penn GSE).

Prior to graduate school, I earned a degree in **Psychology** (with a Specialization in Developmental Psychology) and a minor in **Education Studies** from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).

Broadly, I'm interested in **designing meaningful, technology-enhanced learning experiences for students.**
