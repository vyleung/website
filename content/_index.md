# About
Hello! I'm Vivian.

I'm a master's student in the **Learning Sciences and Technologies** program at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education (Penn GSE).

Prior to graduate school, I studied at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where I earned a degree in **Psychology** (with a Specialization in Developmental Psychology) and a minor in **Education Studies**.

Broadly, I'm interested in **enhancing the design and user experiences of educational technologies.**
