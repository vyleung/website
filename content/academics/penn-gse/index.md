An overview of my master's program in Learning Sciences and Technologies (LST) at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education (2022-2023).

# Program Information
The [LST program at Penn GSE](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/programs/learning-sciences-technology-masters) is housed within the Learning, Teaching, and Literacies (LTL) division and consists of 10 course units (CU's):
- 5 <span class="gse core">Core</span> courses
- 2 <span class="gse concentration">Concentration</span> courses
- 3 <span class="gse elective">Elective</span> courses

The program takes 1-2 years to complete, depending on the number of courses taken each semester. I completed the program in 1 year by taking 4 courses in the Fall and Spring semesters and 2 courses during the summer. 

See the timeline below for the courses I took during each semester. I hope this is helpful for prospective students interested in the LST program at Penn GSE. Feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn if you have any questions ðŸ™‚

# Program Timeline
Note: There are two EDUC 5100 courses because they were both experimental courses in the Learning, Teaching, and Literacies (LTL) division. These courses may vary by semester.

# Course Structure
Penn GSE follows the semester system, which comprises 15 weeks. <span class="gse core">Core</span> and <span class="gse concentration">Concentration</span> courses in the LST program typically have a midterm paper during Week 8 or 9 and a final paper/project due during the last week of the semester. Assignments for these courses involved readings, discussion posts/annotations, responses to peers' discussion posts/annotations, 1-2 discussion facilitation sessions, and presentations. The structure of elective courses will vary based on the program.
