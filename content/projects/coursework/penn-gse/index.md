A selection of my course projects at Penn GSE.

# EDUC 6139: Design of Learning Environments
**Aug 2022 – Dec 2022**  
For the final project of the course, my friend and I designed **GeomeTree**, a mobile app that provides middle school students with supplementary, interactive exercises of various geometry topics. The app has 6 main features: a pedagogical agent, 3 modes (practice, review, and quiz), a playground, and 2 mini games. Secondary features of the app include a teacher dashboard and a tree view, where students can visualize their progress. See the slide deck below to learn more.

# EDUC 6168: Capstone
**Jan 2023 – May 2023**  
"Promoting Nutrition Education and Proportional Reasoning in Middle School Through Mobile, Inquiry-based Learning Activities"

My capstone project consists of 2 parts: 1) inquiry-based learning activity guides that integrated nutrition topics (e.g., serving and portion sizes) into proportional reasoning lessons for middle school students and 2) a mobile app that supported students' engagement in the activities. Each activity is first done in class and then extended to the home context to enable students to connect what they learn in school to their everyday lives. 

See the slide deck below to view the activity guide for the "Portion Sizes and Serving Sizes" activity in the "Eating & Drinking Habits" module.

# EDUC 7847: Social and Statistical Network Analysis
**May 2023 – Jun 2023**

For the course assignments, we were tasked with creating an interactive network visualization about a topic using publication information (e.g., author names and IDs, titles of publication, and citation counts) from Scopus. I chose to explore the topic of learning analytics, specifically focusing on journal articles published from 2010 to 2022 in the United States.
