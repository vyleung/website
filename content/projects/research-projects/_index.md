## Formal Research Projects
### SharKubb
**Jun 2021 - Aug 2021**  
Sharkubb is one study of a series of studies from the [Cognitive Development Lab](http://www.gopniklab.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley investigating the developmental trajectory of 4-10 year olds' decision-making during play and goal-oriented situations.

{{< figure default="true" src="CDL/sharkubb.png" alt="SharKubb" caption="In the study, we played a game with children ages 4-10 years old called _Beach Bowling_. Children were presented with different aspects of the game (e.g. weight of the blocks) and were asked to decide how to adjust the aspects (e.g. all light, all heavy, or half light and half heavy blocks) in 2 situations (playing for fun or to win stickers).">}}

### Patterning in Children
**Sep 2020 – Jun 2021**  
Undergraduate Thesis at UC San Diego: "Using Exploration to Support Children's Pattern Learning"

{{< figure default="true" class="PiC" src="PiC/PiC_shape_examples.png" alt="Shape examples" caption="We placed a black dot in the middle of the shapes to indicate to children that they can move the shapes and to guide them where to click/tap.">}}

{{< figure default="true" class="PiC" src="PiC/PiC_overview.gif" alt="Study overview" caption="This is an overview of the patterning study. The study was created using Google Slides and conducted with children 4-6 years old via Zoom.">}}

{{< figure default="true" class="PiC" src="PiC/PiC_duplication_task_reveal.png" alt="Duplication task reveal" caption="All slides were revealed incrementally along with verbal instructions to help draw children's attention to each aspect of the slide. In this task, children were asked to duplicate the pattern.">}}

<br>

{{< figure default="true" class="PiC" src="PiC/PiC_houses_task_reveal.png" alt="Houses task reveal" caption="In this novel patterning task, children either engaged in pattern learning via demonstration (watching the experimenter move the houses to reveal a star/no star) or exploration (moving the houses on their own to reveal a star/no star). Stars were hidden under every third house. After completing this task, children were shown the same repeating pattern (but with lightbulbs instead of houses) and were given 5 chances to find the stars.">}}

{{< details "Results" >}}
Children who learned by exploring tended to find more stars and display more advanced patterning strategies than children who learned by watching a demonstration.

### ClassInSight
**Jan 2018 – Jun 2021**  
[ClassInSight](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/news/2018/25m-grant-received-study-science-teaching) is a 5-year design-based research project involving Carnegie Melleon University, Penn State University, and UC San Diego that studies how secondary science teachers facilitate rich classroom discussions. I assisted with conducting on a systematic literature review, processing video, audio, and transcript data, and analyzing teachers' baseline interviews. My work helped to inform the design of the ClassInSight web application that was developed for teachers to reflect on visualizations of their discussions.
