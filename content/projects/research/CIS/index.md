# About the Study
[ClassInSight](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/news/2018/25m-grant-received-study-science-teaching) is a 5-year design-based research project involving Carnegie Melleon University, Penn State University, and UC San Diego that studies how secondary science teachers facilitate rich classroom discussions. I assisted with conducting on a systematic literature review, processing video, audio, and transcript data, and analyzing teachers' baseline interviews. My work helped to inform the design of the ClassInSight web application that was developed for teachers to reflect on visualizations of their discussions.
