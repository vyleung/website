# About the Project
[ClassInSight](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/news/2018/25m-grant-received-study-science-teaching) is a 5-year design-based research project involving Carnegie Melleon University, Penn State University, and UC San Diego that studies how secondary science teachers facilitate rich classroom discussions.

# Responsibilities
I assisted with conducting on a systematic literature review on the use of video in teacher professional development; processing video, audio, and transcript data from classroom observations and interviews; and analyzing teachers' baseline interviews. My work informed the design of a visualization in the ClassInSight web application to help teachers set goals on their faciliation of discussions.
