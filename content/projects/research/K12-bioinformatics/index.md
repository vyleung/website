# About the Project
The K-12 Bioinformatics project is a multi-year project that involved developing a curriculum to educate high school science teachers about data literacy, mobile learning, and bioinformatics. The curriculum engaged students in learning about, collecting, and analyzing air quality data in Philadelphia.

# Responsibiilties
I assisted with collaboratively analyzing videos of classroom lessons and students' investigations to understand teachers' adaptive expertise in teaching bioinformatics and students' emerging epistemic emotions.
