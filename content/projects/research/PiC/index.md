# About the Study
My undergraduate thesis is titled "Using Exploration to Support Children's Pattern Learning."

# Study Design

{{< figure default="true" class="PiC" src="PiC_duplication_task_reveal.png" alt="Duplication task reveal" caption="All slides were revealed incrementally along with verbal instructions to help draw children's attention to each aspect of the slide. In this task, children were asked to duplicate the pattern.">}}

{{< figure default="true" class="PiC" src="PiC_houses_task_reveal.png" alt="Houses task reveal" caption="In this novel patterning task, children either engaged in pattern learning via demonstration (watching the experimenter move the houses to reveal a star/no star) or exploration (moving the houses on their own to reveal a star/no star). Stars were hidden under every third house. After completing this task, children were shown the same repeating pattern (but with lightbulbs instead of houses) and were given 5 chances to find the stars.">}}

# Study Results
Children who learned by exploring tended to find more stars and display more advanced patterning strategies than children who learned by watching a demonstration. Check out the [data analysis and visualizations.](https://github.com/vyleung/PiC/blob/main/pic_visualizations_VL.ipynb)
